# Active Attribute Inference Against Well-Generalized Models In Federated Learning
This repository contains code to reproduce results from the paper __Active Attribute Inference Against Well-Generalized Models In Federated Learning__ (experiments with CelebA). This paper has been accepted to **IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (Euro S&P) 2025**

To run this code you must have the packages listed in requirements.txt.

The folder public contains the following files: CelebA_EDA.ipynb to explore the CelebA dataset and Example.ipynb to showcase how to perform experiments. The rest of the files contain relevant code to train federated models, perform attacks and apply defense mechanisms.

The folder data_celeba and celeba_models contain data, trained and attacked models, as well as model performance monitorization from experiments with the CelebA dataset.
