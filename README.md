# Active-Attribute-Inference-Against-Well-Generalized-Models-In-Federated-Learning
Code to reproduce results from the paper __Active Attribute Inference Against Well-Generalized Models In Federated Learning__ (experiments with CelebA).

To run this code you must have packages listed in requirments.txt.

Folder public contains the following files: CelebA_EDA.ipynb to explore the CelebA dataset and Example.ipynb to showcase how to perform experiments. The rest of the files contain relevant code to train federated models, perform attacks and apply defense mechanisms.

Folder data_celeba and celeba_models contain data, trained and attacked models, as well as model performance monitorization from experiments with the CelebA dataset.
